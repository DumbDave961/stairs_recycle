Adds recipes to get resources back from inner and outer stairs. Most inner stairs can be crafted into normal stairs. Most outer stairs can be crafted into slabs. Stairs and slabs in turn can be crafted into full blocks. Inner and outer stairs made of bronze, copper, steel, or tin can be smelted into ingots using a furnace.
